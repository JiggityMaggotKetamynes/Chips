# Chips

A commodities to proprietary exchange and options trading platform.

## Overview

We create a crypto currency "Chips" that is smart contracts enabled. On top of this blockchain, we create commodity backed tokens (for gold, oil, timber, etc.) that can only be traded for our Chips coin. 

We create fully backed two way options contracts between our Commodity tokens and Chip that can be be traded as NFTs. Then we can operate lending services that can provide margin lending for trading on our platform. We can also let people invest in short term bonds that are just the other side of the margin loans.

At the same time we begin operating "gift shop" that are just stores that sell products in Chip coins natively (not through visa and master cards which charge additional fees). The major point here is that we can act like Amazon and run this as a lose leader to provide value and liquidity to our Chips.
