## Script 1 minute (CD) intro


C: Hi, I'm Chris

D: Hi, I'm Davis, and we are the founders of Chips

C: Chips - 

Smart-contract crypto for trading, finance, and retail that enables users to pair-trade their choice of commodities, and gain yields through staking

D: Yea, when we looked at the FOREX markets, we realized that in order to trade futures on two commodities, you would need be short commodity A/USD and long commodity B/US
 
C: We propose a system to obviate the double trade, and allow true price discovey throgh our Chips coin, esssentially weighting one commodity in terms of the other. 

D: The volume of forex is around 6.6 trillion with current protocl, and that's right, I've never been able to speculate on how I think that gold will appreciate over Monero, the crpytocurrency, which I want to do bad!

C: Chips replaces the dollar in the form of the unit of account, and the
denomination of the options spread to enable boundless price-discovery throgh seamless commodity pairing. 

C: We've designed a block-chain protocol that allows user flexilibity to acces the service through their own node, or an application built on L1 

D: Sign me up!

Thanks
