##  notes
// ( we looked at the FOREX markets, we realized that in order to trade futures on two commodities, you would need be short commodity A/USD and long commodity B/US
currecy intrisncially linked -- 
oil and natural gas -- not intrinsically 
triangular currency pair/ dollar suros dollars sterling sterling ueros, have to equal each other. pairs buy one, sell the other, net zero the third 
sold euro dollar, bought eruo sterling, two euro trades cancel out. left with dollar sterling exchange... 
sum of the three have to equal each other -- intrinically linked -- no fixed rod// 
Non-intrinsic links -- write program around that -- more deviation -- 
goldman sachs sell 5 million euro dolalr, atuopmically move sterling euro, euro dollar b/c its a currency pair, selling one and buying the other.
No secondary part to the trade
Euro dollar sell 5 billion 
- selling euros buying dollars -- euro goes up, dollar goes down, euro whacked, buying dollars -- dollars benefits.... 

gas trade, just selling gas for dollars -- dollar value not linked to it//  

sell crude, doesn't necessarily -- impacts price of crude deoniminated in dollars but doesn't really affect dollars 
one part trade not the other

TSLA -- half a billion sell -- nothing else has to move // currency pair eur.dollar dollar benefits and euro loses 

different than singular commodity trade -- 

need to find non-fixed link 

GOld priced in dollars, doesn't impact price in dollar, quasi currency 

crude not linked in the same way --  

what pair trades have close correlation?? sells a load of commodity A, B commodity comes down, loose intrinsic-link// loose currency trade

One-dimensional trade , 

go back and look at more volatile periods, crude 

Will need to test respond
