# YC Application Questions 

<!-- I separated answers into Davis and Christopher to make it simple to compare. 
I will have edit when there was an obvious typo so something, but not when it makes a substantial change -->

## How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

We met 5 months ago at a the Mises Institute for Austrian Economics, summer program "Mises University". We had separate projects we were working on at the time, we kept in touch bc we really wanted to work on a project together.

## Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

Christopher is the technical founder who will right the code on and off blockchain for the company.

## Are you looking for a co-founder?

We are not looking for co-founders, but we are open if we feel someone could substantially add to our team.

## Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.

Smart-contract crypto for trading, finance, and retail

## What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what does it do.

**Davis:**
Company is going to make an application. The application consists of a platform, accessible
through a website/ or app. The platform has the UI of an investing, trading platform. The website
interfaces with a blockchain, a crypto currency. The website allows users to access the
coins via a hot wallet on the site.

- The coin: The coin has a large nominal supply, such that it use as unit of account is relative to dollar denomination(not like Japanese Yen which is 150x 1 dollar). The coin is fast, and cheaply saleable
P2P. The utility of the coin comes with the utility the user has for it to trade. The user does
not at first trade the coins for dollars, or goods. Instead, the user uses the coin to
speculate on the futures market of commodities, goods that are sold w/ prices.
    - The utility of the coin: the coin is the unit of account, and the speculation vehicle,
for a perpetual futures contract. A perpetual futures contract of any two
commodities, namely those that haven’t been paired previously, or prohibited to
be paired.
        - Users acquire coins through mining, airdrop(instant egalitarian issuance),
atomic swaps w/ other currencies, or purchasing it w/ dollars, other
cyrptos
        -  Users can stake their coins that pay yields – driven by demand for
leverage
    - Users use existing reasons for speculation/ financial instrumentation in places
they previously could not.
    - Cold storage available via node or app interface(hot/cold)
 
## How far along are you?

**Davis:** Pitch theorized and hashed out, continuing to polish demo & website.

## How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

1 week, part time (for both of us), but we are ramping up to work on it full time starting this week.

## What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?

**Christopher:** HTMX, Templ, Go. We are currently testing with a vanilla fork of Ethereum, but we expect to use a heavily customized fork of one of 3 or 4 other options. 

## If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

<!--Probably best if you answer here. -->

**Christopher:**

## Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?


**Davis:**
Q1) To capitalize on inefficiencies of dollar
Q2) team consists of technical and soft skills in financial markets, currencies and
software/crypto development
Q3) Null hypothesis: People don’t care to expand quality & restrictions of existing financial
speculation/instrumentation + escape from dollar + hide from currency comp

## Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

**Davis:**
Q1) Perpetual swaps denominated in dollars, more-expensive futures trading, 
Q2) People flock to freedom, efficiency over time, financial flexibility

## How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

**Davis:**
Q1) tag gross volume, subscription tiers on website, site & app advertisements + sponsorships, founders start with initial sum of coins(5-10%)
Q2) Forex markets are in the trillions of dollars daily volume and many trades endure broker fees, so to emulate revenue method isn't out of question. 

## If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.

**Davis:**
Emerging market etfs —  a collection of growth-based stocks, whose respective countries are leaning into liberal market policies, such as decreasing capital gains taxes. Market movements that improve revenue translation into net profit and capital return to investors(ability to re-coup investment fast-tracked)

ETF addresses companies in emerging market based on criteria:
- Can the company return profits to shareholders through the taxation system 
- Is the company incentivized to return profits to shareholders 
- Time view of necessary future financing(optimally companies that aren't diluting equity through reckless share issuance)
- Political stability, past, present, future (in specific relation to taxation)

Could be money managers composing of the money managers (exposure to other ETFS) - fund of funds 
Vs. 
Fund of individual(companies across globe)
Fund of country individuals(country specific index)
Fund of specialization across countries(say lumber industries globally)

Internal ETF — no changing to capital structure. Absolutely no use of authorized participants as market makers, hence no ETF share creation and redemption basket tactics. 
TLDR: would not inflate or deflate outstanding shares of ETF even if trading at premiums or discounts.
