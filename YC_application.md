# YC Application Questions 

<!-- I separated answers into Davis and Christopher to make it simple to compare. 
I will have edit when there was an obvious typo so something, but not when it makes a substantial change -->

## How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

We met 5 months ago at a the Mises Institute for Austrian Economics, summer program "Mises University". We had separate projects we were working on at the time, we kept in touch bc we really wanted to work on a project together.

## Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

Christopher is the technical founder who will right the code on and off blockchain for the company.

## Are you looking for a co-founder?

We are not looking for co-founders, but we are open if we feel someone could substantially add to our team.

## Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.

Interoperable Layer 1 blockchain for trading

## What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what does it do.

Company is going to make an application. The application consists of a platform, accessible
through a website/ or app. The platform has the UI of an investing, trading platform. The website
interfaces with a blockchain, and a smart-contract enabled crypto currency. The website allows users to access the
coins via a hot wallet on the site.

- The coin: The coin has a large nominal supply(similiar to dollar). The coin is fast, and cheaply saleable P2P.
The utility of the coin is the ability to trade. The user does
not at first trade the coins for dollars, or goods. Instead, the user uses the coin to
speculate on the futures market of commodities, goods that are sold w/ prices.
    - The utility of the coin: the coin is the unit of account, and the speculation vehicle,
for a perpetual futures contract. Users use existing reasons for speculation/ financial instrumentation in places
they previously could not betweeen commodity pairs(hedging).
        - 1 of our perpetual futures contract consists of any two commodities, existing or previosuly prohibited to
be paired such as (oil, natural gas) (Monero, Gold)
            - Perpetual swaps use a funding rate to pay out P&L based on relative price movmements between paired commodities. We choose perpetual swaps because it is a future contract that is not exercisable, it doesn't require physical future transfer of goods, but allows for exposure to price action. It is like continuing to roll over an options contract indefintely until you close the position.

- The coin functions to facilaite novel price discovery between two commodities by allowing the market to exactly weigh them in terms of the other. The coin allows for a direct path to speculate on perceived correlations
in the market by faciliating direct position of one good in terms of the other.
    - EX: If you want to be short Crude Oil, and long Natural gas, instead of selling Oil/USD, and buying NG/USD, with Chips you trade a perpetual swap on OIL/NG.  
 
- Issuance: Users acquire coins through mining, airdrop(instant egalitarian issuance),
atomic swaps w/ other currencies, or purchasing it w/ dollars, other
cyrptos
        -  Users can stake their coins that pay yields – driven by demand forleverage

- Equity - with increasing coin volume, companies could seamlessly issue equity, in the coin, overcoming previous backlogs and barriers to access public markets and avoiding kyc with the Chips coin. 
- Cold storage available via node or app interface(hot/cold)

To sum up: We are essentially finding a way to introduce a product to the market, and monetize the volume. With perpetual swaps, we can have countless swaps to speculate on, driving volume from different channels, all the while facilitating novel price discovery. 
 
## How far along are you?

Pitch theorized and hashed out, continuing to polish demo & website.

## How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

1 week, part time (for both of us), but we are ramping up to work on it full time starting this week.

## What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?

**Christopher:** HTMX, Templ, Go. We are currently testing with a vanilla fork of Ethereum, but we expect to use a heavily customized fork of one of 3 or 4 other options. 

## If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

Christopher applied November 12th under company name: Von, description "Use Monero-Gold options to make a stablcoin"

## Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

Q1) I pay close attention to the inefficiences of futures transactions. I haved wanted to directly speculate on the price action of two commodities, to more precisely test for non-inherent links(correlations). Have wanted to more directly capture upside and downside in a single transaction. I think that perpetual swaps have been under-utilized in traditional comoddity futures markets, and are a unqiue way to gain price exposure to goods w/o needing to exercise an options contract(that includes title transfer and phyiscal movmement of goods). I believe that Chips will provide more efficient transactions, on larger breadth of goods to an increasing volume of traders with a public, decentralized ledger.  

Q2) Team consists of technical and soft skills in financial markets, currencies and software/crypto development.  

Q3) My sentiment is that traders are motivated by their curiosity to buy a new IPO, ICO; to test a coins utility and increase their economic and financial capabilities. If traders can fulfill trades and speculation with increased flexibility, write their own options contracts on any commodity pair of their choosing, they will find utility in that service. 

## Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Q1) Our competitors are existing brokerages, trading platforms that plan to expand their tradable markets. 
Q2) Crpyto currencies without inherent utility are worthless. The more traders and holders of a coin that value, interact and usse it's capabilites, this becomes the underlying charactheristic for success. 

## How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

Q1) trading fees, subscription tiers on website for more extensive packages(advanced trading), site & app advertisements + sponsorships, equity partners start with initial sum of coins(5-10%). If the coin attains it's goal of being efficiently saleable aside from trading on the platform, and becomes a tenable medium of exchange, this in turn will increase demand for the coin and increase the value for existing holders. Holders of the coin are also free to stake to generate small yields, which are the costs for leverage traders to borrow money. 
Q2) Forex markets are in the trillions of dollars daily volume and many trades endure broker fees, so to emulate revenue method isn't out of question. 

## If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.

- Truth Bond: a platform that uses AI and/or user submitted summaries of book, videos, articals, etc. to with concrete predictions, eg. the M5 will be 30% faster than AMD's new cpu, Iran has 40 hypersonic missiles that it will use of Israel attacks Iraq. A betting market place will be used to create a betting marketplace that whoes data can be used by decison makers and a custom AI.

If the author was correct on certain prediction then they get a portion of the bonds that increased with there demonstrated accuracy.

- Emerging market etfs —  a collection of growth-based stocks, whose respective countries are leaning into liberal market policies, such as decreasing capital gains taxes. Market movements that improve revenue translation into net profit and capital return to investors(ability to re-coup investment fast-tracked)

ETF addresses companies in emerging market based on criteria:
- Can the company return profits to shareholders through the taxation system 
- Is the company incentivized to return profits to shareholders 
- Time view of necessary future financing(optimally companies that aren't diluting equity through reckless share issuance)
- Political stability, past, present, future (in specific relation to taxation)

- Fund of individual(companies across globe)
- Fund of country individuals(country specific index)
- Fund of specialization across countries(say lumber industries globally)

Internal ETF — no changing to capital structure. Absolutely no use of authorized participants as market makers, hence no ETF share creation and redemption basket tactics. 
TLDR: would not inflate or deflate outstanding shares of ETF even if trading at premiums or discounts.
