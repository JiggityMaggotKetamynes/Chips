## Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

My microeconomics class in high-school. There was an initial test on material followed by possible retake. I didn't study for the initial, used intuition, didn't perform well, reflected on all mistakes and aced the retake. 
This process was limited by the professor claiming that I was gaming the system while in in my defense I was iterating through my best responses to find the Nash Equilibrium.

## Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

My business Tera Solutions that I co-started earlier this year in Asúncion, Paraguay. 
The value prop was agglomerating local services(shipping, logistics, maintenance, legal and property) bundling them up and fast-tracking the ability for miners interested in cheap, renewable energy to start their mine in Paraguay.
There lacked a system that directly catered and provided a track to miners looking to ship their mines, and get them on site firing. 
The team parsed through circuitous legal procedures and procedural fluff, and focused on setting up the site, the LLC, the energy contract far faster 
and reliably than a forthcoming miner could when they would have to deal with a cohort of disjoint processes and persons in a foreign country.

## Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

I'm a technical generalist who's main value comes from knowledge specialization. Knowledge specialization for operational efficiency, finance, and business development; solving financial, operational and sales problems and pursuing opportunities.
As an entrepreneur I constantly try to anticipate, prepare for future conditions by thinking of products that would serve an unmet market need. Iterating through future and past products to provide value and be of service to the customers. 
On technical grounds, there is nothing to mention, however I can point to the success of operating my business Tera Solutions this year. 

<!-- I wonder if it would be better if you used your answer for question 2 on question 3. Im just thinking out loud -->
