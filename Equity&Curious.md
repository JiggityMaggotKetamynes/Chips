## If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. 

## If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)

Eric Christopher Johnson, Jr.
Role: CEO

Initial equity endowments:

IF accepted into YC: would be willing and ready to accept terms, conditions of initial valuation and desired equity

<!-- I think this is a binary question. My understanding is that they only negociate with former succsessful founders -->

## What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

I started a business that I took as far as I could before the business opertunity went way. I am extremtly         intrested in trying again, and YC seems like it is the best envirment to take what I have already leard from hands on experience and build on it.

YC was sugested by a firend at MIT who knew several YC founders, he thought that our project would apeal to YC.

How did you hear about Y Combinator?
